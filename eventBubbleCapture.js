//event Bubbling - Event Bubbling is the event starts from the deepest element or target element to its parents, 
//then all its ancestors which are on the way to bottom to top. 
//At present, all the modern browsers have event bubbling as the default way of event flow.

//event capturing - Event Capturing is the event starts from top element to target element. 
//Modern browser doesnâ€™t support event capturing by default but we can achieve that by code in JavaScript using useCapture.

//When we add event listener to some element, we pass arguments as addEventListener(eventType, callback function, useCapture)
//the third argument useCapture(boolean) is the argument that helps us to achieve event propogation - event bubbling and event capturing.

//stop propogation - The stopPropagation() method of the Event interface prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.
